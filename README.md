About setwave5200
=================

This is an early, but working, work in progress.

Please see the upstream repository for all the details. This project is not backwards
compatible with the original project. It contains reworked scripts for uploading
data to the 2017 version of the MHS-5200. Differences from the original one:
* 12-bit samples mean 4096 values
* 128 bytes per chunk

Also, all help files in this project assume using minicom instead of bare tty driver.
